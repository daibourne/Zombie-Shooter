# Zombie-Shooter
A straightforward zombie shooter game where zombies move across the screen from right to left. Your goal is to maneuver the marine on the left side to align with the zombies and eliminate them. As you eliminate more zombies, their speed increases. Each zombie is worth 20 points, and achieving a score over 700 points leads to victory

Notes
Optimal experience in fullscreen. Certain elements of the game may not be visible if not in fullscreen mode.

Inspiration
I drew inspiration for this game from the browser games of my childhood, where zombies would pursue you on the screen, and you had to shoot them while avoiding their attacks. Anticipating the challenge, I decided to adopt the Plants vs Zombies style, with enemies moving across the screen.
